Project Roadmap:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.14.9x-dev Current PHASEX development branch, wrapping up development
	    of tons of new features and bugfixes.

0.14.9x     Current release branch, stabilizing changes from
	    v0.14.9x-dev.

0.15.x-dev  Next dev series.  New stable features and bugfixes from
	    v0.15.x-dev will be merged into v0.15.x for releases.
	    Restructure code under the hood without affecting behavior
	    in a negative way (ie, redesign the preferences, redesign
	    param sensitivity, restructure gui layout code for even
	    more flexibility, lower the CPU utilization for note
	    triggering, etc.).  Improve session management.

0.15.x      Next stable branch.  Work toward stability and useability.
            Fix issues with current features, gathering changes from
	    0.15.x-dev as they become stable.

0.16.x-dev  Dev series branched from final v0.15.x release.  The
	    v0.15.x-dev series will focus on new API support and new
	    major features (to be determined with the help of
	    community feedback).

0.16.x      Stable release branch, gathering new features as they
	    become stable from v0.16.x-dev.

0.17.x-dev  Dev series branched from final v0.16.x release.  Overhaul
            parameter data structures, add generic controller
            conversions, implement mod-matrix, possibly add new synth
            parameters, improve MIDI spec support.  V0.17.x-dev will
	    focus on architectural changes necessary for future goals
	    (like separating GUI, synth engine, and app framework out
	    into separate libraries).

0.17.x      Stable release branch based on v0.17.x-dev.  This series
	    will most likely see more architectural changes than new
	    features.

0.18.x-dev  ??? Plugin API support, with goals of supporting plugins
	    in signal chain, native synth plugin builds, and synth
	    plugin hosting.
